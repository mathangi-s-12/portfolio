project: Personal Portfolio
date_released: "08.2025"
project_summary: >-
  This project is my personal portfolio—a playground where I put my design chops
  and frontend skills on full display. Built with React and deployed via
  Netlify, it’s not just a portfolio but also an experiment: I dove into the
  world of Git-based CMSs by integrating Decap to manage content dynamically.


  Curious about the nuts and bolts? Head over to the GitHub repo and give the README a spin for all the juicy details. And, of course, you’re looking at the live result right now—enjoy the ride!

project: Personal Portfolio
date_released: "11.2025"
project_summary: >-
  This project is my **personal portfolio**—a playground where I put my design chops
  and frontend skills on full display. Built with **React** and deployed via
  **Netlify**, it’s not just a portfolio but also an experiment: I dove into the
  world of **Git-based CMSs** by integrating **Decap** to manage content dynamically.


  Curious about the nuts and bolts? Head over to the GitHub repo and give the README a spin for all the juicy details. And, of course, you’re **looking at the live result** right now—enjoy the ride!

project: LightCraft
date_released: "12.2025"
project_summary: I’m currently working on **LightCraft**, a React Native app
  that makes controlling the RGB LED strip on my nighstand simple
  and fun. My goal is to give you full color customization, brightness control,
  and smart scheduling—all from your phone. The project is still in progress,
  but I’m aiming for a release in the **second half of December**. In the
  meantime, you can follow my work and check updates on GitHub. Stay tuned!

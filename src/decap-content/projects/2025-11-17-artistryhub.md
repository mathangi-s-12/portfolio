project: ArtistryHub
date_released: "03.2026"
project_summary: I’m working on a platform called **ArtistryHub**, a website
  designed to help artists showcase their digital creations in a beautiful and
  interactive way. The goal is to provide a clean, responsive interface for
  browsing art, secure user authentication, and easy media uploads—all powered
  by modern web technologies. I’m building this using **React** for the
  frontend, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Node.js** for the backend, with
  **OAuth** for authentication, **Firestore** for data storage, and
  **Cloudinary** for image hosting. The project is still under construction,
  with a goal to release it by early March 2026. In the meantime, you can follow
  my progress and check out the code on GitHub.
